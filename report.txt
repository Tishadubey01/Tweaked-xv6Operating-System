schdulertest.c

this file is used to check the scheduling algorithms. The child processes are of different types as the I/O
and CPU loops depend on the child number and so there is a good blend of both CPU and
IO times.

DATA

scheduler   rtime   wtime

PBS           35     114
FCFS          70     84
MLFQ          58     135
RR            20     120

Conclusion:
1. FCFS is the slowest because overall turnaround time is increased , which is caused by CPU bound processes executing before I/O bound processes.
2. MLFQ and PBS are comparatively faster.
3. RR is the fastest, and executes a little faster than MLFQ and PBS as it gives fair run time to all the forked processes.
4. RR<=MLFQ<=PBS<FCFS

Question answer:
If a process comes back and rejoins queuing network after leaving for I/O, it would be inserted into the tail of the same queue, and thus if processes with high I/O demand, will continue to be part of higher priority queues for a long amount of time, which will give it an advantage over other processes, which will keep getting pushed to lower queues.
